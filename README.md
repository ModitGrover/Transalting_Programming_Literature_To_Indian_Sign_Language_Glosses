Translating Programming Literature to Indian Sign Language Glosses

This web application aims to facilitate accessibility to programming literature for the deaf and hard of hearing community by providing translations into Indian Sign Language (ISL) glosses. It consists of two main parts:

Part 1: Manual Translation

Users can input text directly into the application, and it will be translated into ISL glosses in real-time. This feature enables individuals to convert programming content into sign language on demand, empowering them to learn coding concepts at their own pace.

Part 2: File Translation

Users can upload text files containing programming literature, and the application will generate an ISL file with the corresponding glosses. This functionality allows for bulk translation of programming resources, making it easier to provide accessible content for deaf learners.

Features

Real-time Translation: Instant conversion of text input into ISL glosses.
Bulk Translation: Efficient processing of text files to generate ISL gloss files.
